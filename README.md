# Gurugram Real Estate Price Prediction â€“ Data Training Repository  

##  Project Overview  
This repository focuses on **data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and machine learning model training** for predicting real estate prices in Gurugram.  
The dataset was collected via **web scraping from 99acres.com** for both **flats** and **houses**, cleaned, merged, and transformed into a structured format.  
Multiple ML models and encoding strategies were tested to identify the most accurate price prediction model.  

ðŸ‘‰ The **deployment** part of this project is available in a separate repository: [Gurguram_Real_Estate](#).

##  Dataset Description  
- **Source**: Web scraped from 99acres.com  
- **Raw size**: ~4000 records (after cleaning â†’ **3635 records**)  
- **Features collected**:  
  - Property Type (Flat / House)  
  - Sector & Location Info  
  - Built-up Area  
  - Price & Price per sqft  
  - Balcony, Furnishing Type, Age of Property  
  - Latitude & Longitude (geo-coordinates)  
  - And more property-specific features
